# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Japanese-language technical book project about "Computational Physicalism" - a theory exploring the equivalence between human and AI intelligence. The book is written in Markdown format for publication on Zenn (Japanese technical article platform).

## Repository Structure

- `computational-physicalism-zenn-1.md` through `computational-physicalism-zenn-4.md` - Main book chapters
- `writing-environment.md` - Comprehensive guide for book publishing template setup
- `tech-book-writing-6phases.md` - 6-phase methodology for technical book writing with AI
- `it_book_proofreading_prompt.md` - Professional proofreading checklist

## Key Commands and Workflows

Since this is a content-focused project without build tools, common operations include:

### Content Management
- Use standard text editing tools to modify markdown files
- Follow CommonMark + extensions (Mermaid, math, footnotes) for formatting
- Maintain UTF-8 encoding and LF line endings

### Writing Methodology
When editing or creating content, follow the 6-phase process:
1. **Planning & Value Design** - Define reader profiles and structure
2. **Structure Design** - Create detailed table of contents
3. **Exploratory Writing** - Use Claude Opus for creative drafts
4. **Structure Improvement** - Refine based on insights
5. **Full Writing** - Use Claude Sonnet for efficient refinement
6. **Quality Assurance** - Apply 5-stage proofreading process

### Quality Standards
Apply the 5-stage proofreading process:
1. **Technical Proofreading** - Verify accuracy and reproducibility
2. **Language Proofreading** - Fix typos and maintain consistency
3. **Structural Proofreading** - Ensure logical flow
4. **Editorial Review** - Fact-check and verify compliance
5. **Format Proofreading** - Check visual consistency

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Principles
- Focus on explaining concepts and principles through text
- Minimize code examples - use only when necessary
- Maintain an exploratory, peer-to-peer tone
- Build knowledge systematically from basics to advanced
- Use precise technical terminology consistently

### Japanese Language Considerations
- Maintain formal technical writing style (です・ます調)
- Use appropriate technical katakana terms
- Follow Japanese punctuation rules (。、)
- Ensure proper spacing around English terms

### Mathematical Content
- Use LaTeX notation for mathematical expressions
- Ensure all proofs are rigorous and complete
- Provide intuitive explanations alongside formal definitions
- Reference established theorems and papers appropriately

## Important Notes

1. This is a philosophical/technical book project, not a software project
2. The content explores deep questions about consciousness, intelligence, and computation
3. Maintain academic rigor while ensuring accessibility
4. The target audience includes both technical professionals and philosophically interested readers
5. Content should bridge theoretical computer science, philosophy of mind, and AI ethics
